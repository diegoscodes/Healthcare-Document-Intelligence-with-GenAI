Project Name MediRAG

Healthcare Document Intelligence with GenAI

From complex healthcare documents to structured, actionable data.

For Healthcare + GenAI roles, MediRAG is the most balanced option.

Project Overview
What is MediRAG?
MediRAG is a GenAI-based Document Intelligence system designed to process, understand, and structure complex healthcare and pharmaceutical documents such as:
- Pharmacy Agreements
- Prior Authorizations
- Clinical and Administrative Healthcare Documents

It combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to transform unstructured documents (PDFs, long-form text) into structured, reliable, and auditable data.

What the system does (functional scope)
MediRAG runs an end-to-end production-style pipeline, including:
- Document upload and ingestion (PDFs and complex long-form text)
- Cleaning, chunking, and normalization
- Semantic indexing
- Embedding generation
- Vector storage for efficient retrieval
- RAG pipeline:
  - Retrieves relevant passages from the document
  - Sends controlled context to the LLM
  - Reduces hallucination and improves accuracy
- Structured extraction:
  - Converts text into validated JSON
  - Examples:
    - Medication name
    - Eligibility rules
    - Dates, limits, approvals
    - Clinical or administrative restrictions
- SQL database persistence:
  - Document history
  - Metadata
  - Extraction results
  - Versioning
- Professional backend API:
  - Built with FastAPI
  - Clear, documented endpoints
  - Ready for integration with other systems
- Simple React interface:
  - Document viewing
  - Human review of extracted data
  - Human-in-the-loop feedback loop
